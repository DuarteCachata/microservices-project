# Example Dockerfile for Spring Boot Microservice
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an EXAMPLE. Students must create their own Dockerfiles
# for each service (user-service, product-service, order-service, api-gateway)
# as part of Week 2 exercises.
#
# See Aulas/Week-02/ for detailed instructions on creating Dockerfiles

# Stage 1: Build
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml first (for better layer caching)
COPY pom.xml .
# Download dependencies
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -S spring && adduser -S spring -G spring
USER spring:spring

# Copy JAR from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose port (adjust for each service: 8080, 8081, 8082, 8083)
EXPOSE 8080

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
